[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

The HTTP Commons library provides shared abstractions and utilities for working with HTTP in Charcoal, serving as a
foundation for both the [HTTP Router](https://github.com/charcoal-dev/http-router)
and [HTTP Client](https://github.com/charcoal-dev/http-client) libraries. It defines common interfaces, value objects,
and
helpers for requests, responses, headers, and status codes, ensuring consistency and interoperability across all
HTTP-related components in the framework.

For detailed information, guidance, and setup instructions regarding this library, please refer to our official
